<h2>My Why</h2>
<p>I’m a doer. I love the aspects, perspectives, and challenges of building things, and seeing them come to life. I have an infatuation with building incredible things.</p>
<h3>User interviews to glanceability testing, prototyping to debugging</h3> <img alt="something like user testing results or a demo" />
<p>I have a track record of working closely with design teams to understand user needs, habits, and expectations. Working with my product teams to design technical solutions that work with business needs and timelines has given me a name for fostering cross-functional teamwork, and delivering award-winning outcomes.</p>
<h2>My Past</h2>
<p>My breadth of experience gives me insight into many aspects of our team. I am ready to cover team gaps while building a strong team and guide agile processes. Eliminating manual steps and driving standards-based automation like CI/CD allows teammates to bring forth real value in more meaningful ways.</p>
<p>My technical background feeds excellence in translating business requirements into technical product specs, and have experience building to those product specs. I have an intrinsic, honed ability to uncover and understand user problems and build solutions that drive real value.</p>
<h2>Our Team</h2> <img alt="up and to the right image" />
<p>I’ve spent time working with leadership teams to help pivot from a reactive, technical support approach to a proactive, user experience-based mindset.  I enjoy mentoring junior teammates to drive team focus towards quality by exploring tools, discussing architecture options, and encouraging involvement in communities. Things from local Slack communities like Denver Devs and Denver UX, conferences, and even participating in StackOverflow questions are great ways to get a wider knowledge base from which to grow skills, be it fundamentals or specific ideologies.</p>
