<h3>From User Interviews to Glanceability Testing</h3>
<p>I have a track record of working closely with design teams to understand user needs, habits, and expectations. Working with product owners  to design technical solutions for  business needs and within timelines has given me a name for fostering cross-functional teamwork and delivering award-winning outcomes.</p>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>My breadth of experience gives me insight into many aspects of our team. I am able to cover team gaps while building trust and guiding agile processes. Eliminating manual steps and driving standards-based automation (CI/CD) allows individuals to bring forth their value in more meaningful ways.</p>
<p>My technical background feeds excellence in translating business requirements into technical product specs. I have an intrinsic, honed ability to uncover and understand user problems and build solutions that drive real value.</p>

<h2>Our Team</h2>
<p>I’ve spent time working with leadership teams to help pivot from a reactive, technical support approach to a proactive, user experience-based mindset. I enjoy mentoring junior teammates to drive team focus towards quality by exploring tools, discussing architecture options, and encouraging involvement in communities. Things from local Slack communities, conferences, and even participating in StackOverflow questions are great ways to get a wider knowledge base from which to grow skills, be it fundamentals or specific ideologies.</p> -->
