        A successful approach that has helped me gain insignt into thought processes behind user behavior is to 
        create a user test on <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">User Testing</a>.
        Showing the user an existing interface, I ask them to discuss aloud how they feel about
        solutions and why they arrived at that answer. The results include the user's audio and a video screencap
        so you can see them acting out your sample scenarios.

      <h3>Route End Feedback Loop</h3>
      <p>Improvements to where and when we ask users for feedback and reviews brought our store rating up, and
        consequently
        also brought up the app ranking and usage stats.</p>

      <div class="pl-5">
        <div class="card bg-light mt-3 mb-4">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h4 class="card-title">How and When to Ask</h4>
            <p class="card-text">We had a simple display asking users to review after the 4th successful route
              completion. Route completions were
              below 20%, so seeing this at all was very rare. This meant that most users who rated the app were rating
              because they
              had a terrible experience. Not only that, but there was no clear way for users to provide feedback to us
              in a
              constructive way.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-light mt-3 mb-4">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h4 class="card-title">Learn &amp; Pivot</h4>
            <p class="card-text">We first added an option to provide feedback into an existing confirmation alert that
              is shown when a user exits
              navigation, allowing them to provide feedback, just exit nav, or cancel the action. The thinking here was
              to allow
              users to provide us feedback on a route that wasn’t working for them right at the moment that they are
              exiting
              navigation.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Due to the placement of this option, we saw a 10x spike in emails to our customer
              service team. Unfortunately, most
              were blank- indicating users were just clicking to get out of the navigation session rather than
              purposefully trying
              to provide feedback. We quickly removed this option to get users back on the right path there. This was
              obviously the
              wrong placement. Time to try again.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-light mt-3 mb-4">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h4 class="card-title">Final Product</h4>
            <p class="card-text">A teammate brought up the idea of providing the same review/feedback option that we do
              when the user
              successfully arrives. We had since started showing this option for every successful arrival, it makes
              perfect sense to
              stay consistent here and provide the same unobtrusive options at the end of navigation, whether the user
              has
              successfully arrived or not. We ended with a consistent experience that offers users the option of rating
              or providing
              feedback after any route.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card-body">
            <h4>Measuring Success</h4>
            <p>Success was measured by the amount of positive reviews as well as the amount of actionable feedback
              received by our
              customer experience team. The ratings skyrocketed from 5 1-star reviews and just 3 5-star reviews (a 2.8
              average for
              the version) to 10 1-star reviews and 64 5-star reviews (a 4.3 average for the version) in 2 releases.</p>
            <p>As a bonus, the app’s ranking in the store increased because of the higher rating, causing downloads and
              UV’s to
              follow suit and shoot through the roof. Our >4-star rating KPI had been achieved.</p>
          </div>

        <h4>Continued Iteration</h4>
        <p>We continued to iterate on this feedback loop, as well other areas of the app!</p>
